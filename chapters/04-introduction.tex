\section{Motivation}


\section{Research overview}

At a high level, the research presented in this thesis is motivated by two key characteristics exhibited by serverless applications

Problem 1: They run for a short time which makes it difficult for structures to train

Problem 2: They are highly modular which increases communication overhead

Overall, this thesis makes 3 primary contributions:
