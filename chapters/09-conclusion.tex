\section{Conclusion}
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a highly attractive programming model
due to its ease of deployment, zero provisioning overhead for
developers and its ability to compose functions written in multiple
different programming languages. However, the short-running nature of
FaaS functions challenges the assumptions that conventional
microarchitecture are designed under which makes them perform less
efficiently. In this thesis, we have explored the analysis and
optimization of serverless functions from the hardware and software
perspective.
