The multi-megabyte instruction footprints of contemporary server applications cause frequent BTB and \liningfigures{L1-I} misses, which have become major performance limiters. Because BTB capacity greatly affects front-end performance by dictating pipeline flush rate and the efficacy of fetch-directed instruction prefetching, commercial products allocate tens to hundreds of KBs of storage to BTBs. We observe that the single largest contributor to the BTB storage cost is the cost of storing branch target. We further observe that BTB storage cost can be drastically reduced by storing target offsets instead of full or even compressed targets. This is because targets of most branches lie relatively close to the branches themselves and our analysis shows that more than 99\% of offsets can be represented with at most half the bits required to store the full targets. Based on these observations, we propose a storage-effective BTB organization, called BTB-X, that stores target offsets in place of target address. Furthermore, BTB-X, an 8-way set associative BTB, uses differently sized ways with each storing offsets of a different length, thus accounting for the uneven distribution of offset lengths. Overall, BTB-X is capable of storing about 2.24x more branches than a conventional BTB and 1.3x more branches than a state-of-the-art BTB organization within the same storage budget.
