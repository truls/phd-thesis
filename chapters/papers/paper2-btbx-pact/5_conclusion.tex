\section{Conclusion}
\label{pact:sec:concl}

As BTB capacity greatly affects front-end performance, commercial products allocate tens to hundreds of KBs of storage to BTBs. We propose a storage-effective BTB organization, called BTB-X, that stores target offsets in place of full target addresses and employs differently sized BTB-ways for storing offsets of different lengths, thus drastically reducing BTB storage requirements.
