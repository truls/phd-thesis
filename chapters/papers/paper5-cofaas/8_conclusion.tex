\section{Conclusion}

We have now presented CoFaaS which exploits the well-defined RPC interfaces of FaaS applications to automatically consolidate functions on top of a Wasm runtime --- thereby alleviating inter-function communication overhead by not accessing the network layer when functions are scheduled on the same compute node. Our evaluation showed that CoFaaS is highly effective and reduces inter-function communication latency by up to 100$\times$ and application-level request round-trip time by up to 6$\times$.
