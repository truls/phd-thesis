  abstract =     {Serverless computing is a rapidly growing cloud
                  application model, popularized by Amazon's Lambda
                  platform. Serverless cloud services provide
                  fine-grained provisioning of resources, which scale
                  automatically with user
                  demand. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) applications
                  follow this serverless model, with the developer
                  providing their application as a set of functions
                  which are executed in response to a user- or
                  system-generated event. Functions are designed to be
                  short-lived and execute inside containers or virtual
                  machines, introducing a range of system-level
                  overheads. This paper studies the architectural
                  implications of this emerging paradigm. Using the
                  commercial-grade Apache OpenWhisk FaaS platform on
                  real servers, this work investigates and identifies
                  the architectural implications of FaaS serverless
                  computing. The workloads, along with the way that
                  FaaS inherently interleaves short functions from
                  many tenants frustrates many of the
                  locality-preserving architectural structures common
                  in modern processors. In particular, we find that:
                  FaaS containerization brings up to 20x slowdown
                  compared to native execution, cold-start can be over
                  10x a short function's execution time, branch
                  mispredictions per kilo-instruction are 20x higher
                  for short functions, memory bandwidth increases by
                  6x due to the invocation pattern, and IPC decreases
                  by as much as 35 \% due to inter-function
                  interference. We open-source FaaSProfiler, the FaaS
                  testing and profiling platform that we developed for
                  this work.},

  abstract =     {Serverless computing has emerged as a widely-used
                  paradigm for deploying services in the cloud. In
                  serverless, developers organize their applications
                  as a collection of functions, which are invoked
                  on-demand in response to a trigger, such as a user
                  request or an invocation by another function. To
                  avoid long start-up delays associated with booting a
                  new function instance, cloud providers tend to keep
                  recently-triggered functions idle (or warm) on the
                  server for some time after the most recent
                  invocation in anticipation of another
                  invocation. Thus, at any given moment on a server,
                  there may be thousands of distinct warm function
                  instances whose executions are interleaved in time
                  based on incoming invocations.  This paper observes
                  that (1) there is a high degree of interleav- ing
                  among warm functions on a given server; (2) the
                  individual warm functions are invoked relatively
                  infrequently, often at the granularity of seconds or
                  minutes; and (3) many functions complete within a
                  few milliseconds. The infrequent invocations of a
                  function instance on a busy server leads to
                  thrashing of the function’s microarchitectural state
                  between invocations.  Meanwhile, the short execution
                  time of the function impedes amortization of the
                  warm-up latency of the cache hierarchy, causing a
                  31-114\% increase in CPI compared to execution with
                  warm microarchitectural state. We identify on-chip
                  misses for instructions as a major contributor to
                  the performance loss and propose Jukebox, a
                  record-and-replay instruction prefetcher
                  specifically designed for reducing the start-up
                  latency of warm function instances. Jukebox requires
                  just 32KB of metadata per function instance, and
                  boosts performance by an average of 18.7\% for the
                  evaluated functions, which translates into a
                  corresponding throughput improvement at the server
                  level.,},

                  microarchitecture has become painfully
                  difficult. Increasing microarchitecture complexity,
                  workload diversity, and the unmanageable volume of
                  data produced by performance tools increase the
                  optimization challenges. At the same time resource
                  and time constraints get tougher with recently
                  emerged segments. This further calls for accurate
                  and prompt analysis methods. The insights from this
                  method guide a proposal for a novel performance
                  counters architecture that can determine the true
                  bottlenecks of a general out-of-order
                  processor. Unlike other approaches, our analysis
                  method is low-cost and already featured in
                  in-production systems - it requires just eight
                  simple new performance events to be added to a
                  traditional PMU. It is comprehensive - no
                  restriction to predefined set of performance
                  issues. It accounts for granular bottlenecks in
                  super-scalar cores, missed by earlier approaches.},

                  elasticity for high-productive software
                  development. To achieve this, the serverless sandbox
                  system must address two challenges: strong isolation
                  between function instances, and low startup latency
                  to ensure user experience. While strong isolation
                  can be provided by virtualization-based sandboxes,
                  the initialization of sandbox and application causes
                  non-negligible startup overhead. Conventional
                  sandbox systems fall short in low-latency startup
                  due to their application-agnostic nature: they can
                  only reduce the latency of sandbox initialization
                  through hypervisor and guest kernel customization,
                  which is inadequate and does not mitigate the
                  majority of startup overhead.This paper proposes
                  Catalyzer, a serverless sandbox system design
                  providing both strong isolation and extremely fast
                  function startup. Instead of booting from scratch,
                  Catalyzer restores a virtualization-based function
                  instance from a well-formed checkpoint image and
                  thereby skips the initialization on the critical
                  path (init-less). Catalyzer boosts the restore
                  performance by on-demand recovering both user-level
                  memory state and system state. We also propose a new
                  OS primitive, sfork (sandbox fork), to further
                  reduce the startup latency by directly reusing the
                  state of a running sandbox instance. Fundamentally,
                  Catalyzer removes the initialization cost by reusing
                  state, which enables general optimizations for
                  diverse serverless functions. The evaluation shows
                  that Catalyzer reduces startup latency by orders of
                  magnitude, achieves < 1ms latency in the best case,
                  and significantly reduces the end-to-end latency for
                  real-world workloads. Catalyzer has been adopted by
                  Ant Financial, and we also present lessons learned
                  from industrial development.},

  abstract =     {Serverless computing provides a small runtime
                  container to execute lines of codes without
                  infrastructure management which is similar to
                  Platform as a Service (PaaS) but a functional
                  level. Amazon started the event-driven compute named
                  Lambda functions in 2014 with a 25 concurrent
                  limitation, but it now supports at least a thousand
                  of concurrent invocation to process event messages
                  generated by resources like databases, storage and
                  system logs. Other providers, i.e., Google,
                  Microsoft, and IBM offer a dynamic scaling manager
                  to handle parallel requests of stateless functions
                  in which additional containers are provisioning on
                  new compute nodes for distribution. However, while
                  functions are often developed for microservices and
                  lightweight workload, they are associated with
                  distributed data processing using the concurrent
                  invocations. We claim that the current serverless
                  computing environments can support dynamic
                  applications in parallel when a partitioned task is
                  executable on a small function instance. We present
                  results of throughput, network bandwidth, a file I/O
                  and compute performance regarding the concurrent
                  invocations. We deployed a series of functions for
                  distributed data processing to address the
                  elasticity and then demonstrated the differences
                  between serverless computing and virtual machines
                  for cost efficiency and resource utilization.},

abstract = {The front-end bottleneck is a well-established problem in server workloads owing to their deep software stacks and large instruction working sets. Despite years of research into effective L1-I and BTB prefetching, state-of-the-art techniques force a trade-off between performance and metadata storage costs. This work introduces Shotgun, a BTB-directed front-end prefetcher powered by a new BTB organization that maintains a logical map of an application's instruction footprint, which enables high-efficacy prefetching at low storage cost. To map active code regions, Shotgun precisely tracks an application's global control flow (e.g., function and trap routine entry points) and summarizes local control flow within each code region. Because the local control flow enjoys high spatial locality, with most functions comprised of a handful of instruction cache blocks, it lends itself to a compact region-based encoding. Meanwhile, the global control flow is naturally captured by the application's unconditional branch working set (calls, returns, traps). Based on these insights, Shotgun devotes the bulk of its BTB capacity to branches responsible for the global control flow and a spatial encoding of their target regions. By effectively capturing a map of the application's instruction footprint in the BTB, Shotgun enables highly effective BTB-directed prefetching. Using a storage budget equivalent to a conventional BTB, Shotgun outperforms the state-of-the-art BTB-directed front-end prefetcher by up to 14\% on a set of varied commercial workloads.},
